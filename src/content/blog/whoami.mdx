# Greetings

Welcome to my personal website!

Here's a place where I share my experiences in the shortest way without filling the page with useless introductions.

In my blog posts, I may write about various different topics. It could be something that I have learnt recently, a best practice that I found useful, a really basic thing that requires _zero_ tech knowledge, or some repetitive posts that you may have already seen everywhere!

## Who am I?

You may already know, I'm Ali Hashemi.

A mainly backend (Golang) developer who also does a lot of other things like frontend development too.

> No, I'll never call myself a "full-stack developer," because I'm not good at frontend at all! But I'm used to it for some reasons.

Thanks for reading.
